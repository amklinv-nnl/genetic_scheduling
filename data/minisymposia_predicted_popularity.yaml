    \ solve the large scale and grand challenging problems, the adaptive numerical\
    \ methods aim to obtain a solution\_within prescribed accuracy using (almost)\
    \ the least amount of computational costs.\_This minisymposium will bring together\
    \ researchers to discuss recent advances in developing and analyzing a posteriori\
    \ error estimation for a variety of finite element methods, including classical\
    \ FEM, least-squares FEM, virtual element method, and immersed finite element\
    \ method (a FEM with unfitted meshes)."

Accelerating Electronic Structure Calculations with GPUs - Part I of II:
  abstract: Several electronic structure codes have been ported to GPUs in recent
    years. However, with recent hardware developments, particularly the architecture
    of some of the new top supercomputers in the world, taking advantage of GPU accelerators
    is becoming a more pressing need in this field. In addition, since First-Principles
    (quantum-based) molecular dynamics can be computationally quite expensive, being
    able to reduce time-to-solution can significantly enhance the accuracy of many
    simulations. Additionally larger problems and longer timescales can be explored.
    In this minisymposium, we will discuss how electronic structure codes, targeting
    various applications in materials sciences, chemistry and biology, are being adapted
    and ported to GPU-based architectures. The speakers will cover a broad range of
    algorithms, models, languages and implementations used today in a variety of codes,
    and will discuss how these developments are helping to push the computational
    limits in real applications.

Advances in Scalable Iterative, Multigrid and Direct Sparse Linear Solvers:
  abstract: Iterative, multigrid and direct solver algorithms for large sparse linear
    systems present different and unique challenges for scaling to very high core
    counts. Krylov methods rely on matrix-vector products and global reductions. The
    number of global reductions can be reduced, however, maintaining numerical stability
    and accuracy is a concern. Communication avoiding Krylov algorithms and pipelined
    variants have been developed to hide these latencies and extend strong scaling.
    For direct solvers, the introduction of new fill and load-balancing are important
    for scaling, in addition to possible matrix partitioning and re-ordering techniques.
    Multigrid methods, either as a preconditioner or stand-alone solver, rely on coarse-grid
    correction together with relaxation and some smoothers may not exhibit sufficient
    fine-grain parallelism. The smoother algorithms work local to a sub-domain and
    can be a hybrid combination of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel. Asynchronous relaxation
    schemes are a more scalable alternative. In addition to coarse-grain MPI parallelism,
    fine-grain thread based parallelism is also possible but may require  different
    approaches and trade-offs such as higher iteration counts for an overall reduction
    in the time to solution.  We have brought together experts in each of these areas
    who have pioneered new approaches to  improving the parallel scalability of sparse
    solvers.

    media, viscoelasticity, and control designs. While the fractional integral has
    been used to describe the fractal structure of materials which leads to new thermodynamic
    relations, the fractional derivative could be used to describe viscoelasticity
    properties of materials, not only does the calibration of fractional models of
    viscoelasticity with experimental measurements provides less error compare to
    the integer one, but it also provides more information about the structure of
    a material. This area opens up an application of fractional calculus which may
    describe the multiscale thermomechanical material behavior of many polymers. On
    the other hand, fractional calculus has been used in the formulation of variational
    calculus, Euler-Lagrange equations and optimal control systems where the fractional
    derivative has been replaced with the integer derivative to create a new set of
    necessary conditions that must be satisfied by an optimal control law and its
    associated state-control equations. This minisymposium is designed to bring together
    the research scholars who are working in the application of fractional calculus
    in material science and engineering to present their results and exchange ideas

Applications of Machine Learning in Fluid Mechanics:
  abstract: Problems in fluid mechanics can be extremely difficult to solve, as they
    often involve strong nonlinear effects, bifurcations, and turbulence, among other
    technical challenges. Furthermore, since fluid flows are governed by partial differential
    equations, computational solutions often require discretizations with a million
    or more states, leading to extremely high-dimensional models and datasets. Driven
    by innovations in Silicon Valley, machine learning has been proven effective in
    solving a wide array of complex problems, many of which are inherently nonlinear,
    may not have any physical model to rely on, and can involve enormous datasets.
    As such, there is a great deal of interest in whether techniques developed to
    solve problems in Silicon Valley may be helpful in addressing challenges encountered
    in fluid mechanics. This minisymposium presents research demonstrating the promise
    of this approach. Among the methods that will be discussed are linear discriminant
    analysis, support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering, applied to
    a variety of problems in classifying and modeling vortex patterns in bio-inspired
    fluid flows.

Applications of Tensor Decompositions:

    This minisymposium explores applications of tensor decompositions in data analytics,
    across areas spanning signal processing, cybersecurity, machine learning, and
    beyond. The talks will consider additional issues including algorithmic scalability,
    parallelism, and software stacks, among others.

'BE: Best Practices for CSE Diversity and Inclusion':
  abstract: Developing the capacity for innovation and productivity in the global

    (S&T) workforce.  Recent economic projections call for one million more science,
    technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals over the next decade
    in the United States (US).  Yet, less than 40 percent of entering college students
    who intend to major in STEM disciplines actually complete a STEM degree.  Disparities
    in the representation in by women and minorities compound the challenge, and is
    more pronounced in computational science and engineering (CSE) fields.  STEM and
    CSE fields have been historically dominated by a white, male population; however,
    data indicates that there has been movement towards diversification in academics
    and employment.  Yet, the underrepresentation of women and minorities continues
    to be problematic, especially in CSE.

    are usually shared by a number of internal users that, even unintentionally, could
    introduce malicious software. Given the HPC Systems encompasses large amount of
    available resources, such, as CPU, memory and network, these systems are of particular

    in order to launch further attacks towards other resources in the HPC environments.
    Moreover, storing data generated by monitoring tools and security products for

Black-box Optimization for Autotuning:

    the problem (computation time, memory or energy consumption, accuracy of the results,
    ...).  In this minisymposium, the presentations will highlight new methodologies

    "alternative" architectures.  Improved software tools, larger flexible architectures
    (e.g. FPGAs), and lower fabrication costs have lowered the bar to entry.  This
    minisymposium focuses on novel architectures addressing the new application challenges.  These
    are real architectures and real systems for real problems.  They provide testing
    grounds for applications, software frameworks, and our preconceptions on building
    both.  We consider a range from novel memory systems and FPGAs to neuromorphic
    and quantum systems.'

'Close Evaluation of Layer Potentials: Advanced Numerical Methods and Applications':
  abstract: Boundary integral equation methods are useful for solving boundary value
    problems for linear, elliptic, partial differential equations. Rather than solving
    the partial differential equation directly, one represents the solution as a layer
    potential, an integral operator applied to a density over the boundary. The close
    evaluation problem arises in boundary integral methods for numerically computing
    the solution for evaluation points near the boundary. It has been established
    that accuracy of standard numerical methods greatly suffer from the close evaluation
    problem. This session will include recent advances in numerical methods for boundary
    integral equation methods near boundaries and application of these for methods
    for a diverse range of problem. In particular it will cover electromagnetic wave
    propagation and Stokes flow. Topics may include development and analysis of numerical
    methods for boundary integral equations, asymptotic analysis, applications to
    electromagnetic wave propagation or scattering in biological tissue or exotic
    metamaterials, fluid-structure or multiphase flow problems, and more.

Computational Advances and Challenges in Data-enabled Life Sciences:
  abstract: Life sciences, broadly put, have been at the center of the recent data
    revolution. In particular, the use of devices connected to the internet including
    sensors, on-field cameras, and personal medical monitors have become increasingly
    widespread. The data collected by such devices in a wide variety of domains such
    as crop sciences and medicine have enabled a new level of fundamental understanding
    and discoveries. Concurrently, the analysis of large-scale complex datasets has
    also emerged to be an active area of research, spurring new advances in mathematics
    and computational sciences. This minisymposium will bring together experts and
    practitioners from three domains, namely computer scientists, mathematicians,
    and biologists, from both academia and industry, to discuss the advances, challenges
    and opportunities that uniquely arise at the intersection of computational and
    life sciences. In particular, the minisymposium will provide a platform to present
    an overview of the main research challenges stemming out of high-throughput data
    collection in life sciences, and certain key algorithmic and mathematical advancements
    including in the areas of topological data analysis, graph and visual analytics,
    and IoT tools, which are paving the way for tackling those research challenges.
    The overarching goal is to get the audience excited about the outstanding challenges
    in this domain and engage in transdisciplinary efforts toward scientific discovery
    and advancement.

Computational Advances for Large-scale Geophysical Data:
  abstract: 'New geophysical acquisition technologies are enabling the widespread
    collection of continuous streams of data from an unprecedented number of sensors.
    Often, the same dataset may be used for multiple purposes: event detection, source
    inversion, subsurface imaging, and more. To fully exploit these data, new algorithms
    must be developed that scale both in terms of floating point operations and memory
    access. Recent algorithmic advances have included robust automated data pre-processing,  fast
    data transforms and solvers, improved preconditioners for iterative methods, and
    new applications of artificial intelligence to improve efficiency. In this minisymposium,
    we welcome submissions related to algorithmic advances that improve the scalability
    of data analysis with respect to longer times (large-T) or many sensors (large-N),
    or that operate in a streaming paradigm (accessing data a small number of times)
    or a cloud computing environment. This minisymposium will include studies using
    open source data and novel data sources (e.g. smartphone/MEMS accelerometers,
    fiber optics, wireless nodes) and we encourage the presentation of new applications.'

    is the computational challenges in numerical relativity and gravity research as
    we enter the era of regular gravitational wave detections and multi-messenger
    astronomy. This will include discussion of numerical relativity and gravitational

Computational Methods for Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification - Part I of II:
  abstract: Model-based computer simulations about large-scale physical phenomena
    such as the atmosphere provide invaluable, yet uncertain, prediction of the evolution
    of the physical system. The model forecasts are corrected based on other available
    sources of information including measurements of reality, i.e. observations. Observational
    data are fused with model-based forecast, through the process of data assimilation,
    to estimate the trajectory or state of dynamical systems. This method has been
    extensively used in meteorology, hydrology, oceanography among other applications,
    to make accurate predictions about the state of these systems. The quality of
    the output of a data assimilation procedure is critically dependent on the data

Computationally Efficient Derivative-Free Local and Global Optimization:
  abstract: There are many important nonlinear optimization problems for which derivatives
    are not available or they are too expensive to compute numerically. This minisymposium
    will discuss recent advances in computationally efficient derivative-free algorithms
    that can solve these problems. This includes global optimization methods that
    find the best of multiple local minima using a global surrogate to reduce the
    number of evaluations of an expensive objective function required to find an accurate
    solution.  Trust region methods are used for local optimization and in one of

    can reduce the number of function evaluations to obtain an accurate solution and
    are hence especially important for expensive objective functions such as those
    requiring solution of a simulation model. The minisymposium includes the discussion
    of sequential and parallel algorithms that are based on decomposition in order
    to expand the scope of derivative-free optimization to larger-scale problems than
    what was possible in the past. Finally, the discussion includes some real-world

Computing Tensor Decompositions:
  abstract: Tensor decomposition -- representing a multiway tensor by a combination
    of  simple rank-1 components -- is an important operation for processing  and
    discovering features in complex data.  But due to the size and/or  irregularity
    of tensor data, tensor decomposition is challenging both  algorithmically and
    computationally.  Strategies that increase memory locality, reduce computation
    and memory costs, and exploit parallelism can enable efficient analysis of large-
    and extreme-scale tensors.  This minisymposium presents a collection of numerical
    algorithms and implementation techniques that benefit tensor computations.

Data Assimilation and Optimization in Physiologic Modeling - Part I of II:
  abstract: Physics-based modeling for biological systems has been advanced over the
    past decade and plays an increasingly important role in understanding the underlying
    physiological mechanism and assisting clinical management of associated diseases.
    Although increased model complexity can better reveal detailed information of
    the biological system, it also poses great difficulties on how to calibrate the
    model to be patient-specific. Clinical measurement data (e.g., medical imaging)
    can be utilized to perform model calibration and parameter/hidden state estimation,
    which can be formularized as inverse problems. Therefore, proper optimization
    tools and data assimilation techniques are needed. However, solving these inverse
    problems is challenging due to large inter-patient variability and increased computational
    complexity. Moreover, large uncertainties from both clinical data and computational
    model also pose more difficulties. This minisymposium hopes to address the aforementioned
    challenges by reviewing and discussing recent advances in developing efficient
    optimization/data assimilation approaches and quantifying associated uncertainties
    for inverse problems in biomedical applications.

Data Assimilation in Fluid Models:
  abstract: This minisymposium groups talks related to data assimilation and applications
    to fluid problems requiring fast solutions to complex computations. Multiple approaches
    to working with data assimilation problems is made through methods such as graph
    network reduction and machine learning.   These networks are used to model underground
    transport of contaminant particles to predict future concentrations and flows
    underground. We explore using graph networks to find quantities of interest and
    the inversion problem central to relating these quantities back to physical system
    properties. In a related application, the Kalman filter (EnKF) is implemented
    to to determine the key model parameters that have the most impact on material
    deformation and failure fracture propagation.   The application of the Azouani-Olson-Titi
    (AOT) algorithm is used to examine how perturbations of fluid viscosity affect
    the convergence of the AOT algorithm to the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
    A new AOT algorithm with continuous data assimilation is based on feedback control
    from a PDE and weighted least square interpolation is in development. Testing
    for this algorithm is being done on multiple PDEs, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
    equation and 2D shallow water equations.

Data-driven and Mathematical Model Reductions for Combustion System Simulation and Design:
  abstract: Combustion systems are extremely computationally intensive to simulate.
    State of the art high-fidelity fluid-combustion simulations are typically large-eddy
    simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations with detailed chemical mechanisms composed
    of thousands of chemical species and reactions. Such simulations are intractable
    for all but the simplest problems and model reductions are necessary for any simulation
    of a physically relevant combustion system. Typically, such reductions neglect
    some subset of the physics that is not deemed necessary for the current problem.
    Physics reductions introduce error that is difficult to quantify as it is not
    fully know how much of the flow violates the assumptions of the reduction being
    used and for how long. Recent developments, presented in this session, use mathematical
    methods to select the most efficient reduced physics model to attain a target
    level of accuracy in each region of the flow. Such techniques enable the simulation
    of simple combustion devices. However, many problems of interest, remain intractable
    using high-fidelity simulations and, as such, further data-driven and mathematical
    model reductions, such as projection-based reduced basis methods, must be utilized
    to enable design iterations. The rest of this session discusses such methods,
    their pitfalls when applied to combustion problems, and concepts to overcome these
    roadblocks.

Developments in Algebraic Multigrid for Nonsymmetric and Hyperbolic Problems:
  abstract: Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is a relatively mature field of research in
    the applied mathematics community. However, despite several decades of research,
    highly nonsymmetric and hyperbolic-type problems remain difficult for AMG solvers,
    both in theory and in practice. With the continuing growth and evolution of parallel

    are amenable for highly parallel environments. This symposium highlights recent
    developments in the field of nonsymmetric AMG, including two unique theoretical
    frameworks that provide sufficient conditions for convergence-in-norm of nonsymmetric
    AMG, a new nonsymmetric AMG solver based on approximate ideal restriction (AIR),
    and the application of new nonsymmetric AMG methods to nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs.

Efficient Solvers for Coupled Multiphysics Problems - Part I of II:
  abstract: Modeling the simultaneous occurrence of different physical processes is
    an essential requirement for reliable simulation in many computational fluid and
    solid mechanics applications. The interaction between tightly coupled thermal,
    mechanical, chemical and flow processes can play a critical role. The discretization
    of these problems gives rise to linearized equations with an inherent block structure
    reflecting the underlying physical couplings. The development of efficient solution
    strategies, either monolithic or sequential, for such problems is an active field
    of research. This minisymposium aims to join scientists working on multi-physics
    problems, both from a purely algebraic and a more physics-based viewpoint, with
    the objective of sharing experiences and new ideas arising from a wide spectrum
    of applications.

Emerging Trends for Structure Preserving Model Order Reduction - Part I of II:
  abstract: Model Order Reduction (MOR) is an indispensable tool for multi-query simulations
    and (faster than) real-time estimation and control, in particular for multiscale
    and multiphysics problems. Standard MOR approaches, such as, the Reduced Basis
    Method, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, etc. in conjunction with the (Discrete)
    Empirical Interpolation Method, fail to strike an acceptable balance between fidelity
    and complexity to obtain computationally compact representations of several phenomena
    of interest (for instance, multiple-transport phenomena). The limitations of standard
    MOR techniques instigate a drive to develop novel and automated techniques tailored
    for identification of underlying embedding (structure), and, preservation of key
    (physical) model properties (such as, positivity, evolving discontinuous front,
    etc.) and system theoretic properties (for instance, Port-Hamiltonian structure,
    propagation delays, stability, etc.) of the associated (parametric) reduced-order
    models, which are guaranteed to offer robust approximation with lowest possible
    reduced-order representation. In this minisymposium, we will discuss recent advances
    and perspectives in the field of structure and property preserving (discretization
    and) MOR frameworks to deal with (large-scale) linear and non-linear dynamical

Exploiting Model Hierarchies, Sparsity and Low-Rank Structure of Large-scale Bayesian Computation - Part I of II:
  abstract: One of the central tasks in modern computational science and engineering
    is to quantify the uncertainty associated with the computational results. This
    can be broadly classified as Bayesian Computation. Frequently these tasks involve
    expensive or intractable numerical models, embedded in likelihood functions that
    involve high-dimensional parameters and/or high-dimensional data sets. The output
    is typically the posterior (post data) distribution of parameters or quantities
    of interest, or statistics of those parameters or quantities. Markov chain Monte
    Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo, and other posterior exploration schemes require
    repeated evaluations of such models, in principle over high-dimensional spaces.
    In this setting, standard algorithms quickly become intractable. Methods for identifying
    and exploiting model hierarchies, low-rank structure and sparsity in the representation

'Flat Low-rank Matrix Formats: Potential and Limitations':
  abstract: In numerous scientific applications, matrices have been shown to possess
    off-diagonal blocks of low numerical rank. Among the different low-rank matrix
    formats proposed to exploit this property, this minisymposium focuses on flat
    formats, that is, formats with no or little hierarchy (as opposed to hierarchical
    formats such as H or HSS matrices). Flat formats include block low-rank (BLR)
    matrices, based on a 2D blocking of the matrix. The simplicity and regularity
    of this BLR format make it easier to take advantage of modern, possibly even heterogeneous,
    architectures. BLR solvers have been shown to achieve good performance on multicore
    and distributed architectures; however, this comes at the price of a higher theoretical
    complexity compared to the nearly linear complexity of hierarchical formats. In
    this minisymposium, we will discuss recent advances made on the BLR format. In
    addition, we will also present two recently proposed new flat formats, namely
    multilevel BLR (MBLR) and lattice-H matrices, which aim at achieving an improved
    compromise between asymptotic complexity and parallel performance.

'Generalizable Machine Learning and Clustering Methods: Applications in Bias, Biology, and Imaging':
  abstract: As the implementation of machine learning methods become more commonplace
    to answer questions in science and society, the need for generalizable methods
    have increased. At the same, these methods should be approached with appropriate
    domain knowledge of the particular research question and understanding of any
    underlying bias. The talks in this session will present advances in these methods
    in the context of bias, biology, and imaging applications. The first talk will
    address optimization and machine learning methods to detect genomic variation
    in related individuals. The second communication will incorporate data from intensive

Graph and Combinatorial Algorithms for Enabling Exascale Applications - Part II of II:
  abstract: 'Combinatorial algorithms in general and graph algorithms in particular
    play a critical enabling role in numerous scientific applications. The low computation
    to communication ratios and irregular memory accesses of these algorithms makes
    them some of the hardest algorithmic kernels to implement on parallel systems.  The
    talks in this minisymposium will consider: (i) exascale applications that drive
    the selection of combinatorial kernels and integration of software tools; (ii)
    combinatorial (graph) kernels such as graph traversals, graph matching, graph

Hardware-aware Algorithms and Numerics for Heterogeneous Supercomputers:
  abstract: 'The advent of heterogeneous supercomputers - consisting of a blend of
    CPUs and GPUs - has promised significant gains in speedup and scalability over
    their homogeneous CPU-only counterparts. However, to effectively utilize them,
    heterogeneous architectures require a paradigm shift in how we develop numerical
    methods and algorithms: while in the past, physics was the main driver for algorithms
    development, today, both physics and hardware need to be accounted for. For example,
    hybrid computing requires numerical methods that increase arithmetic intensity
    and algorithms that reduce data transfers between hardware and across compute
    nodes. The proposed session aims at bringing together some of the most recent
    research in this area with specific applications in evolutionary differential
    equations such as those encountered in fluids, combustion, gas turbines, atmospheric
    flows, and biological transport. Topics will focus numerical methods and algorithms
    that aim at increasing arithmetic intensity and include, but not limited to, scalable
    linear solvers on GPUs, alternative techniques to global linear solvers, block-Implicit
    methods, the use of machine learning to solve linear and nonlinear systems of
    equations, asynchronous algorithms, high-order methods, and others.'

High-order Discontinuous Galerkin and Finite Element Methods for CFD - Part I of II:
  abstract: Given recent developments in computational architectures, high-order discontinuous
    Galerkin and finite element methods are increasingly important for a range of
    applications in computational fluid dynamics. Their low dissipation, compact stencils,
    and high ratio of computation to communication make them well-suited for solving
    flow problems on next-generation many-core architectures. However, despite these
    desirable features, high-order methods suffer from robustness issues in the presence
    of discontinuous features, sharp gradients, and underresolution, which can limit
    their utility in resolving challenging flow features such as shock waves and turbulence.
    Furthermore, the efficient implementation of such methods on modern, massively-parallel,
    memory-constrained architectures presents interesting and important new challenges,
    prompting the development of sophisticated solver technology and matrix-free operators.

Integrated Mathematical and Computational Approaches to Interface Models and Data in Systems Biomedicine:
  abstract: Complex biological systems comprise functional and structural networks
    interacting at different levels and scales i.e. metabolite and enzymatic networks,
    regulatory and co-expression networks, protein-protein interaction networks as
    well as signal transduction pathways that exhibit strong emergent properties.
    Diseases are caused when these networks are functionally or topologically perturbed
    due to a wide range of intrinsic and environmental cues. Integrated mathematical
    and computational approaches as they help decipher the interplay of these networks
    providing a comprehensive quantitative knowledge of the underlying functional
    mechanisms.

Inverse Problems in Machine Learning - Part I of II:
  abstract: Machine learning has been a fast growing area of research since the beginning
    of the 21st century due to the advent of computing resources and availability
    of data. Many of the questions of interest in machine learning can be formulated
    as inverse problems and vice versa. Therefore, it is not surprising that the developments
    in these two seemingly separate  fields are in fact closely related. In this symposium
    we bring together researchers working at the intersection of machine learning
    and inverse problems to discuss recent advances, challenges and strategies in
    each area, aiming to promote cross-pollination and exchange of ideas that lead
    to new directions of research in both communities.

Large-scale PDE-Constrained Optimization Algorithms and Applications:
  abstract: Numerical optimization is a powerful methodology for the control and/or
    design of many engineering systems governed by partial differential equations
    (PDEs). Many data assimilation problems can also be formulated in this framework,
    where the objective function and/or the constraints depend on the solution of
    PDEs. The computational cost of these PDE solutions, however, necessitate additional
    considerations in the optimization algorithms. This is especially true for problems
    that feature large numbers of variables, some of which may also be stochastic
    or integer-valued in nature. In this minisymposium, we will highlight ongoing
    research efforts in the efficient solution of such large-scale PDE-constrained
    optimization problems.

  abstract: When a nondifferentiable inclusion problem in function spaces arises jointly
    with the nonlinearity and differential-algebraic structure of the incompressible
    Navier-Stokes equations, then the resulting challenges continue to be formidable.
    This is the case for flow problems of viscoplastic fluids, gel-like materials
    with a stress-dependent behaviour that switches between viscous flow and plastic
    creep. As of today, simulations of viscoplastic flows in 3D or realistically complex
    2D configurations remain largely infeasible. Thus, state-of-the-art viscoplastic

Low Mach Number AMR Combustion Simulations with PeleLM -  Part I of II:
  abstract: PeleLM is a code for evolving chemically reacting low Mach number flows

    reactions, each potentially evolving with different time scales, all while evolving
    the numerically conservative discretization across multiple levels of mesh refinement
    on a manifold where the equation of state is always satified. PeleLM is being
    used to study the details of turbulence-chemistry interaction in both premixed
    and diffusion flame configurations, from small-scale laboratory experiments to
    large-scale pool fires and wildfires, while it is being simultaneously improved
    and extended to incorporate new physics, and to run efficiently on emerging computing

    of PeleLM via several different combustion-specific applications, and discuss
    improvements to the code that are under development and supported by DOE's Exascale
    Computing Project.  These improvements include arbitrary (CAD-based) 3D geometries,
    electric field effects on charged particles, and incorporation of real gas and
    closed-chamber pressurization effects.  We also discuss further extensions to
    the PeleLM time stepping scheme to support high-order methods, and implementation

Mathematical Methods for Control and Optimization of Large-Scale Energy Networks - Part I of II:
  abstract: Recent developments in the energy market require new mathematical models
    and suitable algorithms for the efficient usage of the existing networks. For
    instance, in the case of electrical power networks, the increase of renewable
    energy sources and the rise of the electric car lead to new challenges for the
    mathematical model and require optimization of the power network. If additionally
    storage units such as batteries are considered, this becomes an even more challenging
    problem. Moreover, the integration of renewable energy sources such as natural
    gas, photovoltaics, and wind energy into the power grids poses new challenges
    from both theoretical and practical sides. Starting from these real-world problems,
    the mathematical aspects of this minisymposium concentrate on methods for large-scale
    energy networks and, in particular, address optimization and stability analysis,
    model predictive control, model-order reduction, uncertainty quantification, and
    related topics on energy networks. The abstract setting allows for consideration

Mathematical Methods for Control and Optimization of Large-scale Energy Networks - Part II of II:
  abstract: Recent developments in the energy market require new mathematical models
    and suitable algorithms for the efficient usage of the existing networks. For
    instance, in the case of electrical power networks, the increase of renewable
    energy sources and the rise of the electric car lead to new challenges for the
    mathematical model and require optimization of the power network. If additionally
    storage units such as batteries are considered, this becomes an even more challenging
    problem. Moreover, the integration of renewable energy sources such as natural
    gas, photovoltaics, and wind energy into the power grids poses new challenges
    from both theoretical and practical sides. Starting from these real-world problems,
    the mathematical aspects of this minisymposium concentrate on methods for large-scale
    energy networks and, in particular, address optimization and stability analysis,
    model predictive control, model-order reduction, uncertainty quantification, and
    related topics on energy networks. The abstract setting allows for consideration
    of applications arising from both, gas and power networks.

Mitigating Communication Costs Using Variable Precision Computing Techniques - Part I of II:
  abstract: "Communication costs, including global data movement between processors\
    \ and local movement within a processor, are becoming significantly more expensive\
    \ compared to arithmetic operations. It is now of high importance to develop algorithms\
    \ with communications costs in mind. Traditionally, to guard against floating-point\
    \ round off errors, we store data in a 64-bit double precision representation\
    \ even when very few significant digits are needed. However, many scientific simulations\
    \ have traditional error polluting the 64-bit representation - truncation error,\
    \ iteration error, and floating-point round off error. Consequently, since many\
    \ of the bits represent error, we are wasting valuable resources. Thus, a simple\
    \ way to reduce communication costs is to reduce the size of the data; either\
    \ using fewer bits, i.e., in a lower precision, or by using a lossy compression\
    \ algorithm. Mixed-precision or lower precision algorithms have had a renewed\
    \ interest not only to mitigate communication costs, but due to the fact that\
    \ GPU\u2019s can perform half precision arithmetic approximately 16 times as fast\

Model Reduction for Problems with Strong Convection, Sharp Gradients, and Discontinuities - Part I of II:
  abstract: Model reduction exploits that many phenomena of interest in science and
    engineering can be approximated well by problem adapted low-dimensional subspaces
    of the high-dimensional solution spaces. Reduced bases are a prominent example,
    but also proper orthogonal decomposition and polynomial chaos can be seen from
    this perspective. However, if coherent structures (e.g., wave fronts or shocks)
    travel through the physical domain, then traditional model reduction techniques
    typically fail because these structures introduce high-dimensional features. This

Model Reduction, Adaptivity, and High Dimensionality in Uncertainty Quantification - Part I of II:
  abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential for credible simulation-aided

    and inverse UQ are intractable when applied to models with a moderate or large
    number of parameters. Exploiting structure of the model input-output map and the

    will focus on goal-oriented techniques whose aim is to reduce the cost of uncertainty
    quantification while simultaneously maintaining or improving accuracy. Areas of
    interest include dimension reduction, sparsity, approximations with non-tensorial

Modeling Resource Utilization and Contention in HPC System-Application Interactions - Part I of II:
  abstract: Application performance, system throughput and stability, and procurement
    specifications can be improved by better understanding of applications' resource
    requirements and the performance impacts of resource contention within a site's
    workload. Production data can potentially provide the most accurate insights,
    however, quantification of resource utilization and contention impact may be difficult
    empirically because relationships between such data and performance are largely
    inferential and controlled conditions for experimentation are difficult to obtain
    in production. Conversely, theoretical models developed in the design phase of
    large-scale systems have missed large-scale contention scenarios and may not capture
    the range of behavior of time-dependent production workloads.  Advances in instrumentation
    and large data analytical and visual techniques can improve our ability to develop
    data-driven models with the fidelity to capture events of interest. Efficient
    techniques for  assessing near-term system behavior with respect to models can

Moment Methods in Kinetic Theory - Part I of II:
  abstract: Kinetic theory enables modeling of numerous physical processes such as
    radiative transfer or rarefied gas flows in the transition or kinetic regime for
    moderate to large Knudsen numbers. Here the Knudsen number relates the mean free
    path of gas particles to the reference length of the system. Instead of tracking
    individual particles, a velocity distribution function is used to model the dynamics
    of the ensemble. Solutions of the underlying Boltzmann equation or variants thereof
    are often computed using moment methods. To that extend, a set of moments of the
    distribution function, including e.g. physical quantities like density, momentum,
    energy, heat flux, stress tensor and other higher moments, is chosen to describe
    the flow properties. The resulting moment equations then describe the evolution
    of these moments.

Mori-Zwanzig Formulation, Implementation and Applications - Part I of II:
  abstract: The Mori-Zwanzig formalism allows reducing the number of variables in
    large systems of coupled equations. For differential equations, the reduced equations
    model the effect of the unresolved variables, leading to a Markovian, memory and
    fluctuating terms. This formalism can be a starting point for multiscale and meso-scale
    modeling, based on first-principles calculations. It can also be used to derive
    popular reduced order models as appropriate limiting cases. In addition to formulating
    better reduced models, there is a growing need for efficient simulation of those
    reduced models. The minisymposium will address the related mathematical and numerical
    issues as well as applications to materials, fluid mechanics, soft matter, biology

    microtubule-motor networks or other types of interacting particles immersed in
    liquid, can exhibit complex dynamics and patterns. Capturing the interplays between
    the particles and the surrounding fluid in continuum or agent-based models presents
    significant challenges as hydrodynamic interactions happen on short and long scales.

Multigrid Solvers for Partially Structured Meshes and for Advanced Architectures:
  abstract: 'Multigrid methods are an important class of iterative solvers and preconditioners
    as they provide fast convergence rates with O(n) complexity on specific classes
    of problems such as elliptic problems with uniform coefficients. While their implementation
    on distributed memory system has been shown to scale well both weakly and strongly,
    the advent of new mixed architectures requires a redesign of some core kernels
    of these methods.  This minisymposium aims at exploring methods leveraging fully
    or partially structured grids: fully structured grids, block-structured grids,
    mixed structured/unstructured grids or nested grids. Exploiting the regularity
    and the predictable indexing of the data leads to new more parallel and scalable
    algorithms.  This minisymposium also focuses on the parallel shared memory implementations
    of these algorithms for mixed architectures as it is an increasingly important
    aspect of high performance computing on recent architectures aiming at scalability
    at exascale.'

Multirate Time Stepping Methods:
  abstract: Time-stepping methods are numerical methods for the time evolution of
    ODEs, DAEs, and evolutionary PDEs. Many applications require specialized time-stepping
    methods in order to enhance efficiency and expose parallelism at the time stepping
    level. Multirate time stepping methods are integration methods that can accommodate
    different time steps for different solution components or different sub-domains
    so that the time step is locally adapted to satisfy stability and consistency
    requirements. The talks in this minisymposium will describe recent novel developments
    in multirate time-stepping methods and demonstrate their benefits in practical
    applications.

Neutrino Transport Methods in Astrophysics - Part I of II:
  abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and compact binary mergers (CBMs) are
    cataclysmic astrophysical events responsible for heavy element synthesis and the
    emission of photon, neutrino, and gravitational wave (GW) signals. They have long
    been targets of instruments covering most of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum,
    and more recently of neutrino and GW detectors. The recent detection of a merging
    binary neutron star pair in EM and GW channels marked a breakthrough for multi-messenger
    astronomy. Harvesting insights into the physical processes driving these events
    from the wealth of data relies heavily on sophisticated models requiring extreme-scale,
    high-fidelity computing. These models solve a coupled system of equations for
    self-gravity, magneto-hydrodynamics, and neutrino transport. In CCSNe and CBMs,
    lepton and four-momentum exchange between neutrinos and matter plays a major role
    in the dynamics. However, neutrino-matter interactions occur under non-equilibrium
    conditions and a kinetic description based on the Boltzmann transport equation
    is warranted. As a six-dimensional phase-space problem, our ability to model these
    astrophysical events with satisfactory realism relies on advances in multi-physics
    and multi-scale algorithms, novel discretization techniques, fast solvers, and
    sustainable software. The goal of this minisymposium is to bring together researchers

Nonlocal Models in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II:

    present in classical PDE-based models. For instance, peridynamics, a nonlocal
    extension of classical continuum mechanics, admits discontinuous solutions and
    naturally describes material failure and damage. Similarly, nonlocal and fractional
    diffusion models can represent anomalous diffusion and heat transfer. Furthermore,
    nonlocal models introduce length scales, which can be used for multiscale modeling.
    Recent years have witnessed a tremendous advance in modeling, mathematical analysis,
    and computational practice for nonlocal problems.  This minisymposium focuses
    on recent developments in peridynamics, nonlocal and fractional diffusion, and
    other related nonlocal models. The topics of interest include and are not limited

    and time-stepping methods for nonlocal models, nonlocal boundary conditions, multiscale

Nonlocal Models in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II:
  abstract: 'Nonlocal models provide a new framework to overcome limitations and challenges
    present in classical PDE-based models. For instance, peridynamics, a nonlocal
    extension of classical continuum mechanics, admits discontinuous solutions and
    naturally describes material failure and damage. Similarly, nonlocal and fractional
    diffusion models can represent anomalous diffusion and heat transfer. Furthermore,
    nonlocal models introduce length scales, which can be used for multiscale modeling.
    Recent years have witnessed a tremendous advance in modeling, mathematical analysis,
    and computational practice for nonlocal problems.  This minisymposium focuses
    on recent developments in peridynamics, nonlocal and fractional diffusion, and
    other related nonlocal models. The topics of interest include and are not limited
    to: peridynamics, nonlocal and fractional mass diffusion and heat transfer, discretization
    and time-stepping methods for nonlocal models, nonlocal boundary conditions, multiscale
    methods and multi-physics modeling with nonlocal models, nonlocal modeling of
    heterogeneous systems, engineering and scientific applications with nonlocal models.'

Novel Adaptation, Decomposition and Expansion Algorithms for a Class of Large Scale Models:
  abstract: Large scale  deterministic and stochastic models on complex geometries  and
    high stochastic dimensions demand efficient computational techniques to avoid
    prohibitive cost to simulate the model.Development of such techniques crucially
    depend on the fundamental properties of the models, such as coercivity in elliptic
    systems and lack of coercivity in standard formulations to understand wave propagation
    in unbounded and heterogeneous media.  We focus on recent developments in developing  efficient
    algorithms for such models using spatial decomposition, expansions, and  basis
    adaptation techniques.

Novel Approaches for Design and Analysis of Chaotic Dynamical Systems - Part I of II:
  abstract: As access to high performance computational resources increases, the demand
    for high-fidelity numerical simulations will only increase. Many of these high-fidelity
    numerical simulations exhibit chaotic behavior, including climate models, scale-resolving
    computational fluid dynamics simulations, combustion models, and even road traffic
    models. The high sensitivity to small perturbations and seemingly random behavior
    of chaotic dynamical systems make conventional design and analysis methods ill-conditioned
    or computationally intractable, especially sensitivity analysis. This minisymposium
    will discuss novel approaches that will allow mathematicians and engineers to
    analyze, design, and control chaotic dynamical systems. Two classes of sensitivity
    analysis approaches for mean flow quantities will be discussed. The first class
    of methods control the exponential growth of unstable linearized perturbations
    and includes least squares shadowing and space-split sensitivity. The second class
    of methods involves linearizing about the mean flow and modeling the linearization
    of the closure terms. Approaches for predicting behavior that deviates from the
    mean, intermittent and extreme events, will be also discussed. Computationally
    efficient implementations of all of these algorithms and further strategies to
    minimize their costs will be discussed in the talks as well as how they can enable
    gradient-based optimization, error estimation, and mesh adaptation for chaotic
    dynamical systems.

Numerical Methods and Regularization for Ill-posed and Ill-conditioned Problems:
  abstract: Ill-posed problems often arise from inverse problems, integral equations
    of the first kind, and statistics. Inverse problems are usually to determine the
    internal structure of a physical system from the outside measured quantities of
    the system, or to determine the unknown input that gives rise to a measure output.
    Examples of inverse problems include electrical impedance tomography (EIT) that
    produces a picture of electric conductivity distribution inside a patient from
    the measurement of the corresponding voltages at the electrodes attached to the
    patient, and solving diffusion equations in negative time direction to detect
    the source of pollution from measurements. It is widely recognized that linear
    systems resulting from discretizing ill-posed problems are ill-conditioned. All
    ill-conditioned linear systems either have the singular values of the coefficient
    matrix decay gradually to zero with no particular gap in the spectrum or have
    large condition numbers. In this minisymposium, we focus on developing numerical
    methods for solving ill-posed problems that avoid introducing ill-conditioned
    discrete systems and numerical algorithms that regularize ill-conditioned discrete
    systems by introducing preconditioners that regularize the spectrum to reduce
    the large condition number. The aim of the methods and algorithms is to reduce
    the computational expense of the conventional methods so that large-scale computation
    for the ill-posed or ill-conditioned problems can be achieved.

Optimal Experimental Design for Bayesian Inverse Problems:
  abstract: "In the context of Bayesian inverse problems, the goal of optimal experimental\
    \ design (OED) is to find the optimal design of a data acquisition system (e.g.,\
    \ location of sensors, what quantities are measured and how often, what sources\
    \ are used in each experiment), so that the uncertainty in the inferred parameter\
    \ field\u2014or in some quantity derived from this field\u2014is minimized with\
    \ respect to some criterion. OED for Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial\
    \ differential equations (PDEs) is an extremely challenging problem. First, the\
    \ parameter to be inferred is often a spatially correlated field and it leads,\
    \ after discretization, to a high dimensional parameter space. Second, the forward\
    \ PDE model is often complex and computationally expensive to solve. Third, the\
    \ design space for the data acquisition system may be very large. And fourth,\
    \ the Bayesian inverse problem\u2014difficult as it is\u2014is just a subproblem\
    \ within the OED problem. This minisymposium explores advances in numerical methods\

Optimization Under Uncertainty Using Multifidelity and Derivative-free Approaches:
  abstract: Optimization under uncertainty broadly describes optimization problems
    in which uncertain parameters enter the objective and constraints. In the derivative-free
    setting, the uncertain parameters and design parameters may be inputs to a (nonlinear)
    black-box model, whose outputs in turn define the optimization problem. In this
    context, one may seek optimal designs that are "robust" to parametric uncertainties
    by, for example, maximizing the expectation of the original objective or minimizing
    its variance. Other formulations include probabilistic (chance) constraints, or
    objective/constraints based on conditional-value-at-risk. Monte Carlo sampling
    can be used to evaluate these quantities, but at considerable expense; this is
    particularly challenging when the underlying models are complex and expensive
    to evaluate. Given limited sample sizes, another challenge is how to take the
    resulting noisy objective or constraint function estimates into account.

Optimization with Coupled PDEs in Multiphysics Applications:
  abstract: In the context of optimization for multiphysics problems, one has to deal
    with coupled PDEs as state constraints. Nowadays, several coupled PDE problems
    can be solved by the use of existing solvers provided by open source software.
    Some of these software packages already incorporate the coupling between several
    disciplines, such as the multiphysics suites SU2 or Kratos. However, the minisymposium
    discusses how to transfer coupled simulations to design and optimization tools.
    In particular, we discuss the setup of appropriate optimization methodologies
    making use of coupled adjoints.

Partitioned and Adaptive Methods for Initial Value Problems - Part I of II:
  abstract: Numerical methods for initial value problems often adapt or partition
    the method to suit the problem.  For differential equations that have a separation
    into stiff and nonstiff terms, methods such as implicit-explicit methods and integrating
    factor methods exploit this structure by partitioning the method based on the
    structure of the differential equation. These methods allow larger stable time-steps
    than standard explicit methods at a smaller computational cost than traditional
    fully implicit methods.  The analysis and efficient implementation of these methods
    requires careful treatment of the adaptivity or partitioning along with accuracy
    and stability.  This minisymposium brings together speakers working on the application
    and analysis of and partitioned methods for initial value problems.

Partitioned and Adaptive Methods for Initial Value Problems - Part II of II:
  abstract: Numerical methods for initial value problems often adapt or partition
    the method to suit the problem.  For differential equations that have a separation
    into stiff and nonstiff terms, methods such as implicit-explicit methods and integrating
    factor methods exploit this structure by partitioning the method based on the
    structure of the differential equation. These methods allow larger stable time-steps
    than standard explicit methods at a smaller computational cost than traditional
    fully implicit methods.  The analysis and efficient implementation of these methods
    requires careful treatment of the adaptivity or partitioning along with accuracy
    and stability.  This minisymposium brings together speakers working on the application
    and analysis of and partitioned methods for initial value problems.

'Performance Portability and Numerical Libraries: Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Science - Part I of II':
  abstract: A software component is said to be performance portable if it performs  well
    across a range of architectures and problem configurations with  modest development

Performance Portability through Source-to-source Code Transformations:
  abstract: While compilers are reasonably effective at optimizing codes, getting
    the highest performance often requires creating special versions of performance-critical
    codes which depend on multiple factors including the specific machine architecture,
    problem parameters, and interactions with other components of the application.
    In this minisymposia, we will discuss the use of source-to-source transformations
    to allow the developer to work at a higher level of abstraction and exploit state-of-the-art
    techniques to create and improve system- and problem-specific code to achieve
    high performance across a range of systems. The evaluation of such systems, the
    level of abstraction and the developer participation in the process are also important
    topics to be discussed.

    to data generated by physics/chemistry simulations and experiments has already
    produced promising results, it is becoming more and more apparent that in order

Preconditioning for High-order Matrix-free PDE Operators - Part I of II:
  abstract: This minisymposium explores various approaches to preconditioning operators
    when no explicit matrix representation is easily available. An ongoing move in
    high-performance computing toward next-generation high-concurrency hardware makes
    the higher arithmetic intensity of high polynomial order discretizations much
    more attractive, but explicit matrix assembly and application of such high-order
    operators rapidly becomes a performance bottleneck. A partial solution to this
    issue is representing the operator in an unassembled or matrix-free setting, taking
    advantage for example of tensor representations of a finite element basis. In
    the unassembled setting, however, it is not at all clear how to precondition the
    operator, especially in situations where a geometric mesh hierarchy is not available.
    In this minisymposium, we consider approaches such as preconditioning a high-order
    method with a lower-order method, unassembled algebraic multigrid preconditioners,
    and related preconditioning methods.

Quantum Computing for Computational Science Applications:
  abstract: Quantum computing is a paradigm of computation where data is encoded on
    the state of particles governed by the law of quantum physics. Prominent algorithms
    such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and Grover's search algorithm
    show that this computational viewpoint on vector spaces can be very powerful.
    From an algorithmic perspective, using a quantum computer amounts to finding a
    list of elementary operations admissible by the quantum memory which realize a
    desired unitary operation.   The field of quantum computing recently witnessed
    a surge of interest from both academic and industrial actors. As a result, research
    on quantum algorithms shifted from a theoretical understanding of their complexity
    to a concrete study of their applications in computational science and engineering.   This
    mini-symposium will focus on recent advances in the field of practical quantum
    computing. The speakers, coming from both academia and industry, will explain
    how scientific applications can benefit from quantum computing and will address
    the main issues in providing efficient quantum simulation algorithms.

Rational Approximation and its Applications:
  abstract: Recent developments of algorithms generating low-cost, high-fidelity approximations,
    such as Adaptive Anderson-Antoulas (AAA), Vector Fitting (VF), and Least-Squares
    Rational Approximation (LSRA), have renewed interest in rational approximation
    for computational science and engineering applications. Recent work formulates
    both system identification and model reduction as a rational approximation problems,
    providing data-driven approaches instead of realization-dependent algorithms.
    Additionally, as rational functions often provide accurate approximations using
    fewer terms than polynomials, they can also solve differential equations with
    fewer degrees of freedom. This minisymposium explores recent advances exploiting
    these algorithms and their impact on system identification, model reduction, and
    function approximation.

Recent Advances in High Order Lagrangian/ALE Methods - Part I of II:
  abstract: The numerical approximation of the Euler equations of gas dynamics in
    a moving frame is a common approach for solving many multiphysics problems involving
    e.g. large deformations, strong shocks and interactions of multiple materials.  In
    Lagrangian methods, the mesh is moving with the fluid velocity, therefore they
    are well-suited for accurate resolution of material interfaces. On the other hand,
    multidimensional Lagrangian meshes tend to tangle so that the mesh elements become
    invalid, and in general cannot represent large deformation. This difficulty can
    be resolved in ALE (Arbitrary-Eulerian-Lagrangian) methods, which assume that
    the mesh moves independently on the flow and therefore offer additional flexibility
    and accuracy.   ALE techniques can also be directly implemented in numerical schemes,
    for example to take into account moving objects, in fluid structure interaction,
    etc.   In both cases, the question of the mesh quality is a central question.  The
    aim of this minisymposium is to bring together the researchers working in the
    fields of Lagrangian hydrodynamics and ALE methods to discuss the state-of-the-art
    of single- and multi-material hydrodynamic simulations. We are particularly interested

Recent Advances in Multirate Time Integration for Multiphysics Problems:
  abstract: Many problems arising in computational science and engineering involve
    multiple physical processes, where complex interactions between these components
    can result in dynamics that evolve on time scales differing by several orders
    of magnitude. This poses significant challenges for accurate and efficient numerical
    simulations that attempt to capture the dynamic behavior of each component. In
    recent years, multirate time integration techniques, which use multiple time steps
    tuned to these disparate physical processes, have shown advantages in multiphysics
    simulations. The main aim of this minisymposium is to present some of the latest
    developments in multirate time integration; however a secondary goal is to bring
    together experts and young researchers working in this field, with practitioners
    who make use of such time integration techniques in science and engineering applications.

Recent Advances in PDE-constrained Optimization under Uncertainty - Part I of II:

    PDE-constrained optimization have enabled many applications of optimal design
    and control to complex deterministic systems in computational science and engineering.
    A major remaining challenge for PDE-constrained optimization is accounting for
    uncertainty in the PDE models. Many PDE models are characterized by uncertain
    parameters due to lack of knowledge or intrinsic variability of the inputs, including
    initial or boundary conditions, sources, coefficients, or geometry.  It is important

Recent Progress in Coordinate-wise Descent Methods:

    \ super high dimensional problems in data sciences and quantum physics revitalizes\
    \ CDM, which takes advantages of CDM\u2019s fast convergence property and asynchronous\
    \ parallel scalability.  Currently CDMs are still under fast development. New\
    \ coordinate-pick strategies are proposed, and momentum acceleration is also combined\
    \ with CDMs to further accelerate the convergence. CDMs are also tailored for\
    \ different applications. For example, leading eigenvalue problem which is important\
    \ in data science and quantum physics are tackled by CDMs recently. Doubly greedy\
    \ primal dual coordinate descent algorithm is developed to solve sparse empirical\
    \ risk minimization. Some asynchronous parallel block coordinate methods are used\
    \ to solve convex optimization problems with non-separable linear constraint.\
    \ CDMs are also used in image processing, signal processing and many more fields."

Reduced Order Modeling for Parametric CFD Problems - Part II of II:
  abstract: Large-scale computing is recurrent in several contexts such as computational
    mechanics or fluid dynamics, due to the high computational complexity in solving
    parametric and/or stochastic systems, based, for instance, on partial differential
    equations. This often leads to an unaffordable computational burden, especially
    when dealing with real-world applications, real-time or multi-query computing.
    In order to lessen this computational burden, reduced-order modeling techniques
    (e.g., reduced basis, proper orthogonal and generalized decomposition, empirical
    interpolation, hierarchical model reduction) play a crucial role as they aim to
    capture the most important features of the problem at hand without giving up accuracy.

Reduced Order Modeling for Parametric CFD Problems-  Part I of II:
  abstract: Large-scale computing is recurrent in several contexts such as computational
    mechanics or fluid dynamics, due to the high computational complexity in solving
    parametric and/or stochastic systems, based, for instance, on partial differential
    equations. This often leads to an unaffordable computational burden, especially
    when dealing with real-world applications, real-time or multi-query computing.
    In order to lessen this computational burden, reduced-order modeling techniques
    (e.g., reduced basis, proper orthogonal and generalized decomposition, empirical
    interpolation, hierarchical model reduction) play a crucial role as they aim to
    capture the most important features of the problem at hand without giving up accuracy.

Resilience for Large Scale CSE Applications - Part I of II:
  abstract: Resilience is an imminent issue for large scale computing systems and
    their applications due to the reliability concerns that stem from the architectural
    complexity to meet the power and performance requirements together. Under such
    unreliable computing systems, it is essential to introduce failure mitigations
    at the runtime and application layers to compliment the resilience at the hardware/system
    levels.  Today, the major resilience scheme is coordinated checkpoint and restart
    (CR) that involves global coordination of processes and threads. This global recovery
    model entails inherent scalability issues to handle a large class of errors and
    failures, and thus alternative approaches would improve the scalability and reliability
    of computing systems and applications together.  In this minisymposium, we will
    discuss the reliability issues of the large scale computing systems, application/algorithm
    based resilience and programming model support to enhance the reliability of application
    program executions.

Roundoff Error in High-Performance Implementations of CG/Lanczos-type Solvers - Part I of II:

    arithmetic, which means that whenever different implementations  are considered
    -- such as implementations that make better use of parallelism --  one must be

SIMD Approaches for Achieving Performance and Portability on Emerging Computational Architectures:
  abstract: Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) is a common technique being used
    by modern computer architectures to achieve high performance in a power-efficient
    manner by increasing the availability of fine-grained parallelism.   Two notable
    examples are the use of vector instructions on modern CPU architectures and warps
    of concurrent threads on GPU architectures.  However harnessing this fine-grained
    parallelism in scientific computing contexts can be quite challenging due to code
    complexity, sparsity and indirection.  In this minisymposium, we explore approaches
    for leveraging fine-grained SIMD parallelism through the use of modern programming
    techniques such as operator overloading, discuss implications for performance
    and portability, and present applications of these ideas within several scientific
    computing contexts.

'Scalable Adaptive Applications: Recent Developments':
  abstract: We present selected applications of scalable adaptive mesh refinement
    (AMR). The focus is on new algorithms for important features and functionalities
    and on latest science applications that rely on such features. Even though several
    algorithmic approaches to AMR are widely and successfully used for the numerical
    solution of partial differential equations, it remains challenging to incorporate
    complex physics, multiple scales, and non-element-based methods, as well as other
    sources of non-locality and non-uniformity.  In this minisymposion, we highlight
    how such generalizations impact performance and scalability. We discuss the particular
    requirements on algorithm and application design at the largest scale, how low-
    and high-level simulation layers depend on each other, and how synergy can be
    maximized.

Scalable Solvers for the Helmholtz Problem - Part I of II:
  abstract: Many wave phenomena can be described by the Helmholtz equation in the  frequency
    domain approach. After discretization large linear systems  have to be solved.
    To maintain a certain accuracy, the discretization  relies on the number of grid
    points per wavelength, which should be as  high as possible. Increasing the wavenumber,
    therefore leads to very  large linear systems.  Most solvers which are available
    have the  property that the number of iterations increases at least linearly with  the
    wave number. Only recently, various methods become available where  the number
    of iterations is independent of the size of the wave number,  and the work per
    iteration is approximately constant, so-called  scalable methods. In this minisymposium
    various methods will be  presented which are scalable when certain conditions
    are satisfied.  Typical applications of these solvers are medical imaging, seismics,  sonar
    etc.

Scientific Data Visualization Platforms Facilitating New Paradigms:
  abstract: The influx of digital data, unprecedented high-performance computing (HPC)
    resources, and advances in visualization algorithms are driving a paradigm shift
    in how scientists work with information in the modern computational landscape.
    This session brings together application scientists and developers leveraging
    the rapidly changing technological advances to facilitate scientific discovery.
    Examples include data analytics, web-based interfaces for working with and analyzing
    data, larger infrastructure CAVES, and portable VR platforms such as 3D TVs or
    the HTC VIVE. For the successful communication of research done with these emerging
    technologies, methods are needed to convey the insights and analysis gained without
    requiring the audience to replicate the technological environment. Movie recordings
    panning through 3D data and simulation output can be one way to convey the depth
    and 3D complexity, as can well-designed web-based applications that allow the
    user to parse data remotely. For facilitating scientific reproducibility in the
    era of HPC and big data, university sponsored streaming and storage sites, such
    as institutional repositories may provide a critical link in moving this new technology
    forward and redefining approaches to scientific research.

State-of-the-art High-order Numerical Methods and Complex Fluid Simulations - Part II of II:
  abstract: Simulating compressible flows is challenging, due to the presence of discontinuities,
    e.g. shock and contact waves, and broad-band continuous flow scales. High-order
    and high-resolution schemes dedicate to resolving smooth flow scales accurately
    and to capturing the discontinuities simultaneously. In the past decades, many
    mathematical concepts, such as the artificial viscosity scheme, the total variation
    diminishing (TVD) scheme, the essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) scheme and the
    weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme, have been proposed and widely
    used in both academic and engineering simulations, as well as the compact scheme,
    flux reconstruction (FR) scheme, spectral volume/difference (SV/D) scheme etc.
    More recently, the high-order numerical methods pay a more and more important
    role in high-fidelity simulations, e.g. the large eddy simulations (LES) and the
    direct numerical simulations (DNS). This session focuses on the state-of-the-arts
    of high-order numerical methods and the complex fluid simulations, including but
    not limited to turbulence, multiphase flows, plasma, MHD flows, combustion etc.

Statistical Applications of Continuous and Discrete Transport - Part I of II:
  abstract: Transport between probability measures offers a rich toolbox of approaches
    for sampling and inference, and for comparing both discrete and continuous distributions.
    Deterministic couplings between probability measures can be induced by transport
    maps that minimize certain cost functionals; more generally, one may derive many
    tools and insights from the construction of optimal transport plans.  Recent theoretical
    and computational advances in this area have enabled the solution to ubiquitous
    statistical problems, including density estimation, variational Bayesian inference
    (parametric and nonparametric), inference with intractable likelihoods, as well
    as nonlinear filtering and smoothing. Despite these successes, efficiently solving
    such problems remains challenging, especially in high dimensions with strongly

Structure Preserving Techniques for Hyperbolic Systems - Part I of II:
  abstract: The generalization of the maximum principle to hyperbolic systems is  the
    notion of convex invariant domains. The key property defining an  invariant domain
    is that for any initial data in the domain in  question, the (entropy satisfying)
    solution to the hyperbolic system  remains in the domain. For instance positive
    density and positive  internal energy are invariant properties for the compressible
    Euler  equations; likewise, positive water height is an invariant property of  the
    shallow water equations. Invariant domain preserving numerical  methods are those
    that preserve invariant domains. Many first-order  methods are known to be invariant-domain
    preserving, but extending  theses techniques to higher-order is non-trivial. The
    difficult  balance consists of being invariant, high-order accurate and to  satisfy
    enough entropy inequalities for the numerical solution to  converge to an entropy
    solution. These three constraints are difficult  to achieve at the same time,
    but are essential to get robust and  accurate methods.  Invariant-domain preserving
    are important in any  application where being 'in bounds' is essential.

Structure-exploiting Techniques for Approximation, Inference and Control of Complex Systems - Part I of II:
  abstract: Data-driven modeling and control of complex systems have received a lot
    of attention over the recent years, largely due to the availability of large datasets.
    Nevertheless, large scale data is not typically informative about the entire physical
    properties because it is often gathered through nonlinear or partially observable
    processes.  In such situations, physically-principled priors that include symmetries
    and constraints are crucial to infer predictive models, typically with filtering

Structured Matrix Methods - Part I of II:

    and low-rank approximations to gain high efficiency in matrix representation and
    arithmetic. They have demonstrated significant advantages in improving the efficiency
    and reliability of some large-scale computations and engineering simulations.
    Rank structured methods extend the fundamental ideas of   multipole and panel-clustering
    methods to general non-local solution operators. While there exist various more
    or less closely related methods, the unifying aim of these methods is to explore
    efficient structured low-rank approximations, especially those exhibiting hierarchical
    or nested forms. These help the methods to achieve nearly   linear complexity.
    In this minisymposium, we aim to present and exchange recent new developments

Tensor-based Methods for Scientific and Engineering Computing:
  abstract: Tensor-based methods are power tools in modern scientific and engineering
    computing, especially for high-dimensional and large data problems. Once a dataset
    has been tensorized, tensor decomposition methods such as the tensor-train (TT)
    or high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) can be used to form extremely
    compact representations, much smaller than the original data size. By limiting
    the rank in a tensor decomposition, it is also possible to find an accurate approximation
    of the original data, which again reduces the size of the representation.  In
    many practical problems, extracting essential information from a huge data set
    has the potential to help enhancing the new scientific discovery or improving
    the physical model. Similar to the singular value decomposition (SVD), principal
    component analysis (PCA) or proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), the tensor
    decomposition methods not only provide a concise representation of the data but
    also help to discovery critical properties of the physical systems. This minisymposium
    will bring in researchers working on numerical analysis, algorithm development
    and applications using tensor-based methods from different areas to leverage the
    enhancement of the tensor methods in scientific and engineering computing.

The Intersection of Graph Algorithms and Machine Learning:
  abstract: 'We are witnessing large growth in the number of proposed graph-theoretic
    and machine learning solutions for a variety of problems. Claims and counterclaims
    are increasingly being made as to which approach is best. In some cases, old problems
    are recast in an alternate approach in the hope of finding a better solution;
    in other cases, an approach is chosen to solve a new problem without necessarily
    a sound theoretical basis for success. The conundrum is that both graph algorithms
    and machine learning can solve many real-world problems, and that their domains
    intersect, but the approaches are not equivalent. For example, both community
    detection algorithms and SVMs partition data into subsets of similar members,
    and Bayesian Networks are a probabilistic graphical model of random variables
    and conditional dependencies used to learn causal relationships. In reality, many
    analytic workloads require both approaches: graphs to understand relationships
    and organizational structures, and machine-learning methods to identify signature
    features.  The talks in this minisymposium will: discuss the problem domains for
    graph methods, machine learning, and their intersections; discuss representations
    that rely on concepts from graph theory, and enable the formulation of machine
    learning problems; provide tractability analysis in terms of complexity, time-to-solution,
    problem size, and quality of solution; discuss integration of graphs and machine
    learning approaches.'

Theoretical and Computational Aspects in Nonlocal and Material Science Modeling - Part I of II:
  abstract: The mathematics of material science encompasses a variety of aspects,
    from formulating models that describe material properties and phenomena, to theoretical
    investigations, and numerical simulations. A variety of models describing local
    and nonlocal effects have been shown successful in applications, their investigation
    and implementation in real-world applications is ongoing attracting the interest
    of a growing community. Nonlocal models such as anomalous diffusion and peridynamics
    can incorporate temporal and spatial nonlocal behaviors due to memory effects
    and long-range forces. For problems where these effects cannot be neglected, such
    descriptions are more accurate than PDEs and have recently gained popularity.
    Mathematical analysis and numerical solutions for nonlocal problems remain challenges,
    requiring new approaches to design robust, efficient and predictive numerical
    methods. The goal of this minisymposium is to bring together researchers working

Theory and Application of Surrogate Models for Bayesian Inverse Problems - Part I of II:
  abstract: Today the availability of exascale computing resources enables high-fidelity
    simulations of complex processes in science and engineering. Moreover, it is becoming
    standard to include and quantify uncertainties in these processes. However, the
    forward and inverse uncertainty quantification with computationally demanding
    models is still infeasible in many situations. Expensive models arise for instance
    in hydrology, oncology, and multiphysics simulations such as fluid structure interaction.
    In practice, such models can be replaced by computationally cheap surrogates based
    on full model runs. Surrogates enable and accelerate uncertainty quantification.
    This minisymposium is dedicated to surrogate modelling for inverse uncertainty
    quantification. We highlight recent theoretical advances from mathematical and
    computational sciences, for example, adaptive strategies for surrogate construction,
    surrogate error analysis, and multifidelity surrogates, together with results
    from practical estimation problems. Surrogate models include Gaussian processes,
    sparse grids, reduced bases, (piecewise) polynomials, and low-rank tensors.

Toward Software Ecosystems for Computational Science and Engineering:
  abstract: Software---cross-cutting technology that connects advances in mathematics,
    computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering---is a cornerstone
    of long-term collaboration and progress in computational science and engineering
    (CSE).  As we leverage unprecedented high-performance computing resources to work
    toward predictive science, software complexity is increasing due to multiphysics
    and multiscale modeling, the coupling of simulations and data analytics, and the
    demand for greater reproducibility and sustainability, all in the midst of disruptive
    architectural changes.  Applications increasingly require the combined use of
    independent software packages, whose development teams have diverse sponsors,
    priorities, software engineering expertise, and processes for development and
    release. The developers of open-source scientific software are increasingly encouraging
    community contributions and considering more effective strategies for connections
    among complementary packages. This speakers in this minisymposium will discuss
    work toward broader software interoperability and scientific software ecosystems
    needed to support next-generation CSE.

    transmission eigenvalues  is very challenging due to the  fact that the corresponding

Using Structure for Scalable Optimization:
  abstract: 'The recent explosion of big-data applications has made it hard for traditional
    convex optimization algorithms to scale. However, in many real-world applications,
    problem structure significantly reduces the space of plausible solutions. In order
    to find these structurally-ideal solutions, often we employ convex regularizers,
    either explicitly or implicitly, for structured sparsity, such as low-rank or
    group-sparse applications.  This minisymposium explores different ways in which
    incorporating problem structure may additionally facilitate the scalability of
    these algorithms. Examples include: designing methods with reduced per-iteration
    cost for structured optimization problems, evaluating the effectiveness of quick-and-dirty
    solutions on real-world problems, and improving the interpretability of favored
    heuristic approaches.'

Wave-based Imaging Meets Machine Learning:
  abstract: Developments in deep convolution neural networks (DCNNs) are driving exiting
    new approaches to problems in computational imaging. These include new ways to
    include learned prior knowledge via denoisers, auto-encoders, possibly in combination
    with unrolling of optimization schemes that are driven by local derivative information
    derived from a data objectives and physics-based forward models.
